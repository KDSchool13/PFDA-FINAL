## Description
My project is a two choice choose your own adventure game played in the python terminal. 
The story focuses on fantasy themes with two settings, a pond and the ocean. 
The project.py file contains all of the main code. 
There are no additional programs required for this code to work. 
The code works by calling main, which calls the first function that kicks off the story.
The function prints the starting line of the story, then prompts the user to input a or b for two different routes.
The function then calls the next function which continues the story depending on weather the user typed a or b. 
The ending functions simply print the ending of the story, instead of calling another function upon input of a or b.
