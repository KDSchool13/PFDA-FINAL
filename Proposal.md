# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-Final
## [Repository Link](https://github.com/KDSchool13/PFDA-FINAL.git)
## Description:
Project will be a choose your own adventure game that directs user through multiple scenarios based off of user input. 
Choose-your-own-adventure games are a fun and interactive form of creative writing through code, which I think would fall under the umbrella of digital arts & media.
## Features:
Screen object to print story scenarios and prompts on.
User input to determine direction of story, either through mouse or type. 
Images and design elements to accompany story - could use pygame. 
## Challenges:
Need to learn how to display images on a screen object, print text on a screen object, and take user input on multiple choice questions. 
## Outcomes: 
### Ideal Outcome:
When the code is run, a window pops up and a story prompt is visible accompanied with an image above, 
the user will be able to click between two or more choices and determine the outcome of the story.
### Minimal Viable Outcome: 
The game is played in the terminal of VS code with no images, but will display story prompts and ask for user input, determining the direction of the story. 
## Milestones:
### Week 1:
Story and different outcomes thought of and written out.
Minimal Viable Outcome Written or majorly worked on. 
### Week 2:
Minimal Viable Outcome finished if not finished in Week 1. 
Research into pygame docs and review previous c08 code for direction.
Start Evolving code to behave more like Ideal Outcome.
### Week 3:
Ideal Outcome finished and project turned in by May 6th.
